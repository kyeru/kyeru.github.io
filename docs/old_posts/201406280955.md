All right.Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words - all right.Alternate Alternative.The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities. As the other one of a series of two, an alternative may stand for "a substitute," but an alternative, although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that is never present with alternate.As the flooded road left them no alternative, they took the alternate route.Among. Between.When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usaully called for: "The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an agreement between the six heirs."- from "The elements of style" 4th edition by W. Strunk JR. and E. B. White
