Default parameter values are evaluated when the function definition is executed.This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the function is defined, and that that same “pre-computed” value is used for each call. This is especially important to understand when a default parameter is a mutable object, such as a list or a dictionary: if the function modifies the object (e.g. by appending an item to a list), the default value is in effect modified. This is generally not what was intended. A way around this is to useNoneas the default, and explicitly test for it in the body of the function, e.g.:
defwhats_on_the_telly(penguin=None):ifpenguinisNone:penguin=[]penguin.append("property of the zoo")returnpenguin
