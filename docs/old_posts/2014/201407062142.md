## Words and expressions commonly misused - 3

<strong><em>Disinterested</em></strong>

Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not interested in."

<blockquote>Let a disinterested person judge our dispute. (an impartial person)<br/>This man is obviously uninterested in our dispute. (couldn't care less)</blockquote>

<strong><em>Enormity</em></strong>

Use only in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." Misleading, if not wrong, when used to express bigness.

<strong><em>Fact</em></strong>

Use this word only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of judgement. That a particular event happened on a given date and that lead melts at a certain temperature are facts. But such conclusions as that Napoleon was the greatest of modern generals or that the climate of California is delightful, however defensible they may be, are not properly called facts.
