### Words and expressions commonly misused - 2

<strong><em>But</em></strong>

Unnecessary after doubt and help.

<blockquote>I have no doubt but that (x) ---------- I have no doubt that (o)<br/>He could not help but see that (x) ---------- He could not help seeing that (o)<br/></blockquote>
<strong><em>Can</em></strong>

Means "am (is, are) able.'" Not to be used as a substitute for may.

<strong><em>Compare</em></strong>

To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus, life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London.

<strong><em>Comprise</em></strong>

Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprises mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it "embraces," or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo - they constitute a zoo.
