## Words and expressions commonly misused - 1

<strong><em>All right.</em></strong>

Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words - all right.

<strong><em>Alternate Alternative.</em></strong>

The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities. As the other one of a series of two, an alternative may stand for "a substitute," but an alternative, although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that is never present with alternate.

<blockquote>As the flooded road left them no alternative, they took the alternate route.</blockquote>

<strong><em>Among. Between.</em></strong>

When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usaully called for: "The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an agreement between the six heirs."
