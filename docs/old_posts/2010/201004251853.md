## I hate caffeine!

because I can't fall asleep until 2:30 a.m. T.TI almost never drink coffee. This evening, at around 6, I just had a cup of "moca frappuccino", not coffee! But this puny amount of caffeine is strong enough to make me awake after midnight.I know I'm very sensitive to caffeine. Nevertheless, this is terrible.
