### Now in Los Angeles


First, I'm so sorry to write in english instead of my own language. A newly purchased laptop in Los Angeles does not support korean typing.This is a temporary note. As soon as possible (maybe after I find my own pace and nice meal), I will continue to write more stuffs about my journey in New York and several days in Los Angeles. Again, I will buy another computer, which is expected to be a desktop instead of this laptop and which I hope more powerful and easy to type, I will write in korean who hate reading in english, too.Thanks to all of my lovely family and friends.
