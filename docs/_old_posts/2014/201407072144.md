### Words and expressions commonly misused - 4

<strong><em>Farther, Further</em></strong>

The two words are commonly interchanged, but there is a distinction worth observing: farther serves best as a distance word, further as a time or quantity word. You chase a ball farther than the other fellow; you pursue a subject further.

<strong><em>Fix</em></strong>

Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend. The usage is well established. But bear in mind that this verb is from figere: "to make firm," "to place definitely." These are the preferred meanings of the word.

<strong><em>Fortuitous</em></strong>

Limited to what happens by chance. Not to be used for fortunate or lucky.
