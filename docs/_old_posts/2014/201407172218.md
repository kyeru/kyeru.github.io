### Words and expressions commonly misused - 5

<strong><em>Gratuitous</em></strong>

Means "unearned," or "unwarranted."

<blockquote>The insult seemd gratuitous. (undeserved)</blockquote>

<em><strong>However</strong></em>

Avoid starting a sentence with however when the meaning is "nevertheless." The word usually serves better when not in first position.

<blockquote>The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeede in reaching camp. (x)<br/>The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded in reaching camp. (o)<br/></blockquote>

When however comes first, it means "in whatever way" or "to whatever extent."

<blockquote>However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks best.<br/>However discouraging the prospect, they never lost heart.<br/></blockquote>

<em><strong>Imply, Infer</strong></em>

Not interchangeable. Something implied is something suggested or indicated, though not expressed. Something inferred is something deduced from evidence at hand.

<blockquote>Farming implies early rising.<br/>Since she was a farmer, we inferred that she got up early.<br/></blockquote>
